# Number plate detection 

# Overview 

The project is built to detect number plate,using YOLOv8.

# Files:

model_training : In this file the data is analyzed and necessary steps are taken to train the model then analyze the outcome,make changes and retrain until a satisfactory outcome is obtained.

detection: Final model is used for training along with code to give output in video format showing the detection.

frames: code to extract frames from the video file.

visualization: Used streamlit to give input video source, output file name and display the input video and detection while saving the output video in the filename provided.
